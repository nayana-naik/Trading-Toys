# Trading-Toys

I created this project for the course Network Based Application Development in UNC Charlotte. I used HTML5, CSS, Node.js, Express and MongoDB as No-SQL database. This website is basically an exchange portal for toys like dolls, cars etc after user authentication. A rating system has been implemented for toys and users in the website.
Some functionalities are incomplete and may not work if you fork this project.
